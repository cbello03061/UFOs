# UFOs

Module 11

## Overview of Project: 
The objective of this project is to generate a web page in which UFO information can be searched, for this, it is necessary to apply the knowledge of Javascript.

## Results:

To achieve the objective it was necessary:
1. Generate a structure to correctly identify the files that would be generated and be able to make the correct call from them.
2. The generated files were:
    - app.js
    -index.html
3. The data file used was data.js

The web page that was developed allows obtaining information on UFO views with different criteria such as:
    - Date
    - Town
    - Condition
    - Country
    - Shape 

The following image corresponds to the main page developed, where a brief introduction is given.




A core point of the development of the page was to be able to generate a filter that would allow us to obtain specific information through the chosen filter.

The following image shows this information


## Summary

This development allowed us to make a deep analysis of the way the files involved should interact, as well as to visualize the potential of JavaScript, the development is good but nevertheless it has several areas of opportunity:
1. Interactive searches that allow the person who is doing the search to delve into the subject.
2. Through a first search, that the page shows you more information according to what you are looking for to generate a concern to continue the investigation.
3. The main page should contain more images of UFOs that allow anyone who browses the page to arouse the curiosity of the search.
